# breeze-sequelize

The `breeze-sequelize` library lets you easily build a Sequelize server for managing relational data.  
Starting with Breeze metadata, it will create the Sequelize model for you, and Sequelize can create a database from the model.

Once you have the model and database, `breeze-sequelize` makes it easy to query and update data from your Breeze client.

## Repo

The [src](./src) folder contains the TypeScript source code.

The [test](./test) folder contains the unit tests (work in progress).

The [test/ExpressDemo](./test/BreezeExpressDemo) folder contains a complete server using breeze-sequelize, for running an end-to-end test suite.
