# breeze-sequelize

This is the official NPM package for the Breeze Sequelize integration. The package files are in the [breeze.server.node](https://github.com/Breeze/breeze.server.node "github: "breeze-server-node") repository in the 'breeze-sequelize' subfolder.

The `breeze-sequelize` library lets you easily build a Sequelize server for managing relational data.  
Starting with Breeze metadata, it will create the Sequelize model for you, and Sequelize can create a database from the model.

Once you have the model and database, `breeze-sequelize` makes it easy to query and update data from your Breeze client.

##  Install

To install with npm, open a terminal or command window and enter:

`npm install breeze-sequelize`

>Case matters! Be sure to spell "breeze-sequelize" in all lowercase.
